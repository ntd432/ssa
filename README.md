# SSA - A Smart Sleep Assistant

Smart Sleep Assistant is a sensor-based system designed to improve sleep hygiene by detecting unhealthy nighttime behaviors and encouraging better habits. It addresses common issues such as irregular sleep schedules, late-night screen use, noise, and poor sleeping environments. Using sensors from the KS5009 kit, the system monitors environmental conditions and user activity to provide gentle nudges—like light dimming, buzzers, and automation—to support restful sleep. By promoting healthier routines, the project aims to enhance well-being, reduce energy consumption, and demonstrate how smart environments can positively influence behavior.

##### The Smart Sleep Assistant is developed as a part of ImpactXChange IoT Hackathon in LUT University
